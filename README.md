# 2048 game made with javascript

author: HeDi (MeloDi)

My first javascript game, and my first time using github.

## How to play

It is a classic 2048 game, where you move the blocks and gain scores. Now, the control is keyboard 'w', 'a', 's', 'd'(arrow keys don't work yet, cause I'm a bit lazy), and on mobile phone you can slide the screen to move the block.

## Something I wanna say

For me, the most hard part in this project is making the animation. I write about 3 versions --- some were pushed while others weren't. Now the latest version is based on CSS3 animation. It is super easy to learn and use.

There are some other difficulties I've met. For example, the upload to github(I'm a freshman! totally), test for cookies(because on my browser I cannot use cookie on local HTMLs, I have to test it on the server)... Anyway, I made it, and hope someone having his fun through it!
